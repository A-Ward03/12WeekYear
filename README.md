# Webpage Project

## Purpose

Welcome to the Webpage Project! This webpage is designed to provide a visually appealing and responsive user experience using HTML and CSS. The primary objective of this project is to showcase the basics of web development and design through the implementation of structured HTML elements and modern CSS styling.

## Future Plans

Although the current version of the webpage is built solely with HTML and CSS, future enhancements are planned to incorporate JavaScript. The integration of JavaScript will add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the webpage, improving user engagement and overall usability. Upcoming features may include interactive forms, dynamic content updates, and enhanced navigation.

## Tracking Progress with the 12 Week Year

This webpage will also serve as a tool to track your progress with the 12 Week Year methodology. You'll be able to set goals, monitor achievements, and visually track your progress over the 12-week period, making it easier to stay on track and achieve your objectives.

Stay tuned for further updates and improvements!
